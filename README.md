Orbiter is a tool for collecting and redistributing webhooks over the network.

## NOTICES

- **This project comes with absolutely NO warranty for break changes**,
- ... but you can file bugs, feature requests and usage questions **if you have to**.


## Features

- [x] Receive and save webhook by time, type (GitHub, etc) and tags (repository, owner, etc).
- [x] Redistribute webhook by APIs whenever and whatever it gets requested.
- [ ] Nice admin dashboard to config and do statistics.

## WTF?

Oh well, it is just a tool to collect webhook history when you don't have time to process them at the moment.

Or, maybe you want to study the history later to understand a basic user action flow.

And nothing else, sorry!

## Installation

First of all, you need to install MySQL (WHAT?!).

Then, install Orbiter:

```
go get github.com/Unknwon/orbiter
```

Please add `-u` flag to update in the future.

Now, go to directory `$GOPATH/src/github.com/Unknwon/orbiter`:

```sh
$ go build
```

### Configuration

The default configuration is located at `conf/app.ini`, please create another file called `custom/app.ini` to adjust your own values.

Finally, execute `./orbiter`.

The server should start listening on `0.0.0.0:8085` by default, visit http://localhost:8085.

## Quick start

### Config New Collector

Collector defines what the type (currently only support GitHub) and secret token should be.

**Secret token is auto-generated by Orbiter, you can ask to regenerate as many times as you prefer**.

Normally, one collector is for an individual repository, but that's up to you.

After creation, setup the webhook with secret token in corresponding hosting site.

For example, in GitHub:

- `Payload URL`: `https://orbiter.unknwon.io/hook?secret=mysecretweapon`
- `Content type`: `application/json`
- `Secret`: **REMAIN EMPTY**
- Events: **ORBITER DOES NOT CARE**

### View Recent History

You can go to `/webhooks` to view recent receive history of webhooks, and their payloads.

Important tags such as **repository owner**, **repository name**, **event type** and **sender** are extracted for payload automatically and can be used as query conditions for applications.

### Add New Application

Application is basically nothing but contains a **access token** which is needed for calling APIs.

## APIs

**All parameters and access token is passed by URL query parameters.**

### List Webhooks

```
GET /api/v1/webhooks
```

##### Parameters

Following parameters are all optional, and combine with condition **AND**.

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|collector_id|List webhooks that were received by certain collector|
|owner|List webhooks that belongs to certain repository owner|
|repo_name|List webhooks that belongs to certain repository|
|event_type|List webhooks that have certain event type|
|sender|List webhooks that were triggered by someone|
|after|List webhooks that received after certain time point, this value is Unix nanoseconds|
|limit|Maximum number of webhooks to response|

##### Example

```
GET /api/v1/webhooks?token=mysecretdefense&event_type=issue_comment&after=1454740438165946316&limit=10
```
